​​
#### **Wireframes:**

Wireframes for each section were created using Balsamiq. This process provided a basic but clear outline of how each section would look as well as organising the content.
The wireframes differ from the finished site as I found it much more captivating to include Art work and images that complimented the overly aesthetics of theme within the Lofi genre.

* Mobile

<br>​

#### **Color Scheme:**
​
I mainly carried out research using google, freepiks and online palette generators to get inspiration, I finally decided these hex colours below:

* #3c1053; #cdb4db,  #320064cc
* #ffd6ff, #ff99cc, #ffb3ec, #ffb3ec66,  #ff66cc, #ffb3ec99
* #ffffff,
* #000000, #00000099
* #c8ffc826
* #c8c8ff26
* #ffffff26
* #00000026

<br>

![Colour Palette](assets/documents/readme-screenshots/colour-palette.png)

The colours used throughout the site reflect the calm, nostalgic and mood associated with the genre of Lofi music. The colours are soft and non invasive, allowing the user to focus on the information and the music promoted on the site.



​
#### **Typography**
​
* Throughout the page, the following fonts are used:
  * Montserrat ('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Montserrat:wght@100..900&display=swap') - I felt it went aesthetically with the overall design of the site and was easy to read.
  * Sans serif - Is the fallback font in the event Montserrat wasn't supported by the browser.
​
* All fonts were sourced from Google fonts, as stated in the credits.

​<br>
