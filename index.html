    <p>Lo-fi music, characterized by its deliberate "low-fidelity" aesthetic, has roots in DIY music practices and has evolved through various musical movements. 
        It emerged in the 1950s with amateur musicians using limited resources and a "homemade" production style. Lo-fi gained traction in the 1960s with bands 
        like The Beach Boys, and again in the 1980s with DJs like William Berger who championed independent home recordings. Lo-fi hip-hop, a specific subgenre, 
        gained popularity in the 2000s, particularly after the advent of samplers like the Roland SP-303 and SP-404, and artists like Nujabes, MF Doom & Madlib, 
        and J Dilla helped popularize it. </p>
